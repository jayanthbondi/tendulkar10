        <p>Sachin Ramesh Tendulkar is a former Indian cricketer and a former captain, widely regarded as one of the greatest
            batsmen of all time. The highest run scorer of all time in International cricket, Tendulkar took up cricket at
            the age of eleven, made his Test debut on 15 November 1989 against Pakistan in Karachi at the age of sixteen,
            and went on to represent Mumbai domestically and India internationally for close to twenty-four years. He is
            the only player to have scored one hundred international centuries, the first batsman to score a double century
            in a One Day International, the holder of the record for the most number of runs in both ODI and Test cricket,
            and the only player to complete more than 30,000 runs in international cricket. In 2002, halfway through his
            career, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack ranked him the second greatest Test batsman of all time, behind Don Bradman,
            and the second greatest ODI batsman of all time, behind Viv Richards. Later in his career, Tendulkar was a part
            of the Indian team that won the 2011 World Cup, his first win in six World Cup appearances for India. He had
            previously been named "Player of the Tournament" at the 2003 edition of the tournament, held in South Africa.
            In 2013, he was the only Indian cricketer included in an all-time Test World XI named to mark the 150th anniversary
            of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack. Tendulkar received the Arjuna Award in 1994 for his outstanding sporting achievement,
            the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award in 1997, India's highest sporting honour, and the Padma Shri and Padma Vibhushan
            awards in 1999 and 2008, respectively, India's fourth and second highest civilian awards. After a few hours of
            his final match on 16 November 2013, the Prime Minister's Office announced the decision to award him the Bharat
            Ratna, India's highest civilian award. He is the youngest recipient to date and the first ever sportsperson to
            receive the award. He also won the 2010 Sir Garfield Sobers Trophy for cricketer of the year at the ICC awards.
            In 2012, Tendulkar was nominated to the Rajya Sabha, the upper house of the Parliament of India. He was also
            the first sportsperson and the first person without an aviation background to be awarded the honorary rank of
            group captain by the Indian Air Force. In 2012, he was named an Honorary Member of the Order of Australia. In
            December 2012, Tendulkar announced his retirement from ODIs. He retired from Twenty20 cricket in October 2013
            and subsequently retired from all forms of cricket on 16 November 2013 after playing his 200th Test match, against
            the West Indies in Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium. Tendulkar played 664 international cricket matches in total, scoring
            34,357 runs.

        </h2>
        <p>All my friends. Settle down let me talk, I will get more and more emotional (crowd gets louder as he composes himself).
            My life, between 22 yards for 24 years, it is hard to believe that that wonderful journey has come to an end,
            but I would like to take this opportunity to thank people who have played an important role in my life. Also,
            for the first time in my life I am carrying this list, to remember all the names in case I forget someone. I
            hope you understand. It's getting a little bit difficult to talk but I will manage. The most important person
            in my life, and I have missed him a lot since 1999 when he passed away, my father. Without his guidance, I don't
            think I would have been standing here in front of you. He gave me freedom at the age of 11, and told me that
            [I should] chase my dreams, but make sure you do not find shortcuts. The path might be difficult but don't give
            up, and I have simply followed his instructions. Above all, he told me to be a nice human being, which I will
            continue to do and try my best. Every time I have done something special [and] showed my bat, it was [for] my
            father. My mother, I don't know how she dealt with such a naughty child like me.</br> I was not easy to manage.
            She must be extremely patient. For a mother, the most important thing is that her child remains safe and healthy
            and fit. That was what she was most bothered and worried about. She took care of me for the last 24 years that
            I have played for India, but even before that she started praying for me the day I started playing cricket. She
            just prayed and prayed and I think her prayers and blessings have given me the strength to go out and perform,
            so a big thank you to my mother for all the sacrifices. In my school days, for four years, I stayed with my uncle
            and aunt because my school was quite far from my home, and they treated me like their son. My aunt, after having
            had a hard day's play, I would be half asleep and she would be feeding me food so I could go again and play tomorrow.
            I can't forget these moments. I am like their son and I am glad it has continued to be the same way. My eldest
            brother, Nitin, and his family, have always encouraged me. My eldest brother doesn't like to talk much, but the
            one thing he always told me is that whatever you do, I know you will always give it 100%, and that I have full
            faith and confidence in you. His encouragement meant a lot to me. My sister, Savita, and her family, was no different.
            The first cricket bat of my life was presented to me by my sister. It was a Kashmir willow bat. But that is where
            the journey began. She is one of those many who still continue to fast when I bat, so thank you very much.
            <br> Ajit, my brother, now what do I talk about him? I don't know. We have lived this dream together. He was the
            one who sacrificed his career for my cricket. He spotted the spark in me. And it all started from the age of
            11 when he took me to Archrekar sir, my coach, and from there on my life changed. You will find this hard to
            believe but even last night he called to discuss my dismissal, knowing that there was a remote chance of batting
            again, but just the habit we have developed, the rapport we have developed, since my birth, has continued and
            it will continue. Maybe when I'm not playing cricket we will still be discussing technique. Various things we
            agreed upon, my technique, and so many technical things which I didn't agree with him, we have had arguments
            and disagreements, but when I look back at all these things in my life, I would have been a lesser cricketer.
            The most beautiful thing happened to me in 1990 when I met my wife, Anjali. Those were special years and it has
            continued and will always continue that way. I know Anjali, being a doctor; there was a wonderful career in front
            of her. When we decided to have a family, Anjali took the initiative to step back and say that 'you continue
            with your cricket and I will take the responsibility of the family'. Without that, I don't think I would have
            been able to play cricket freely and without stress. Thanks for bearing with all my fuss and all my frustrations,
            and all sorts of rubbish that I have spoken. Thanks for bearing with me and always staying by my side through
            all the ups and downs. You are the best partnership I've had in my life.
            <br>Then, the two precious diamonds of my life, Sara and Arjun. They have already grown up. My daughter is 16, my
            son is 14. Time has flown by. I wanted to spend so much time with them on special occasions like their birthdays,
            their annual days, their sports day, going on holidays, whatever. I have missed out on all those things. Thanks
            for your understanding. Both of you have been so, so special to me you cannot imagine. I promise you [that] for
            14 and 16 years I have not spent enough time with both of you, but the next 16 years or even beyond that, everything
            is for you. My in-laws, Anand Mehta and Annabel, both have been so, so supportive [and] loving and caring. I
            have discussed on various things in life, generally with them, and have taken their advice. You know, it's so
            important to have a strong family who is always with you and who are guiding you. Before you start clapping,
            the most important thing they did was allowing me to marry Anjali, so thank you very much. In the last 24 years
            that I have played for India I have made new friends, and before that I have had friends from my childhood. They
            have all had a terrific contribution.</br> As and when I have called them to come and bowl to me at the nets,
            they have left their work aside to come and help me. Be it joining me on holidays and having discussions with
            me on cricket, or how I was a little stressed and wanting to find a solution so I can perform better. All those
            moments my friends were with me. Even for when I was injured, I would wake up in the morning because I couldn't
            sleep and thought that my career was over because of injuries, that is when my friends have woken up at 3 o'clock
            in the morning to drive with me and make me believe that my career was not over. Life would be incomplete without
            all those friends. Thanks for being there for me. My cricket career started when I was 11. The turning point
            of my career was when my brother (Ajit) took me to Achrekar sir. I was extremely delighted to see him up in the
            stands. Normally he sits in front of the television and he watches all the games that I play. When I was 11/12,
            those were the days when I used to hop back on his scooter and play a couple of practice matches a day. The first
            half the innings I would be batting at Shivaji Park, the second half, at some other match in Azad Maidan. He
            would take me all over Mumbai to make sure I got match practice. On a lighter note, in the last 29 years, sir
            has never ever said 'well played' to me because he thought I would get complacent and I would stop working hard.
            Maybe he can push his luck and wish me now, well done on my career, because there are no more matches, sir, in
            my life. I will be witnessing cricket, and cricket will always stay in my heart, but you have had an immense
            contribution in my life, so thank you very much. My cricket for Mumbai started right here on this ground, the
            Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA), which is so dear to me. I remember landing from New Zealand at four o'clock
            in the morning, and turning up for a game here at eight o'clock just because I wanted to be a part of Mumbai
            cricket, and not that somebody forced me. That was for the love of Mumbai cricket, and thank you very much. The
            president is here so thank you very much, along with your team, for taking care of me and looking after my cricket.
            The dream was obviously to play for India, and that is where my association with BCCI started. BCCI was fantastic,
            right from my debut they believed in my ability and selecting me into the squad at the age of 16 was a big step,
            so thanks to all the selectors for having faith in me and the BCCI for giving me the freedom to express myself
            out in the middle. Things would have been different if you had not been behind me, and I really appreciate your
            support.
            <br> Especially when I was injured, you were right with me and making sure that all the treatments were taken care
            of, and that I got fit and fine and playing [right] back for India. The journey has been special, the last 24
            years, I have played with many senior cricketers, and even before that there were many senior cricketers with
            whom I watched on television. They inspired me to play cricket, and to play in the right way. Thanks to all those
            senior cricketers, and unfortunately I have not been able to play with them, but I have high regards for all
            their achievements and all their contributions. We see it on the mega-screen, Rahul, Laxman, Sourav, and Anil,
            who is not here, and my team-mates right here in front me. You are like my family away from home. I have had
            some wonderful times with you. It is going to be difficult to not be part of the dressing room, sharing those
            special moments. All the coaches for their guidance, it has been special for me. I know when MS Dhoni presented
            me the 200th Test match cap on Day One morning. I had a brief message for the team. I would like to repeat that.
            I just feel that all of us are so, so fortunate and proud to be part of the Indian cricket team and serving the
            nation. Knowing all of you guys, I know you will continue to serve the nation in the right spirit and right values.
            I believe we have been the lucky ones to be chosen by the Almighty to serve this sport. Each generation gets
            this opportunity to take care of this sport and serve it to the best of our ability. I have full faith in you
            to continue to serve the nation in the right spirit and to the best of your ability, to bring all the laurels
            to the country. All the very best. I would be failing in my duties if I did not thank all the doctors, the physios,
            the trainers, who have put this difficult body together to go back on the field and be able to play. The amount
            of injuries that I have had in my career, I don't know how you have managed to keep me fit, but without your
            special efforts, it would never have happened. The doctors have met me at weird hours. I mean I have called them
            from Mumbai to Chennai, Mumbai to Delhi, I mean wherever. They have just taken the next flight and left their
            work and families to be with me, which has allowed me to play. So a big thank you to all three of you for keeping
            me in good shape. My dear friend, late Mark Mascarenhas, my first manager. We unfortunately lost him in a car
            accident in 2001, but he was such a well-wisher of cricket, my cricket, and especially Indian cricket. He was
            so passionate. He understood what it takes to represent a nation and gave me all the space to go out and express
            myself, and never pressurised me to do this ad or promotion or whatever the sponsors demanded. He took care of
            that and today I miss him, so thank you Mark for all your contribution. My current management team, WSG, for
            repeating what Mark has done, because when I signed the contract I exactly told them what I want from them, and
            what it requires to represent me. They have done that and respected that. Someone who has worked closely with
            me for 14 years is my manager, Vinod Nayudu. He is more like my family and all the sacrifices, spending time
            away from his family for my work, has been special, so big thank you to his family as well for giving up so much
            time for my work with Vinod. In my school days, when I performed well, the media backed me a lot. They continue
            to do that till this morning. Thank you so much to the media for supporting and appreciating my performances.
            It surely had a positive effect on me. Thank you so much to all the photographers as well for those wonderfully
            captured moments that will stay with me for the rest of my life, so a big thank you to all the photographers.
            I know my speech is getting a bit too long (crowd roars with 'noooo'), but this is the last thing I want to say.
            I want to thank all the people here who have flown in from various parts of the world, and have supported me
            endlessly, whether I scored a 0 or a 100-plus. Your support was so dear to me and meant a lot to me. Whatever
            you have done for me. I know I have met so many guys who have fasted for me, prayed for me, done so much for
            me. Without that life wouldn't have been like this for me. I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart, and
            also say that time has flown by rather quickly, but the memories you have left with me will always be with me
            forever and ever, especially "Sachin, Sachin" which will reverberate in my ears till I stop breathing. Thank
            you very much. If I have missed out on saying something, I hope you understand. Goodbye.
